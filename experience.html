        <p>
          I came from Chile to Sweden with my mother in a cold winter of '87. Her goal was to create a better future in a free country.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up in a small town mostly doing small town stuff. In high school i went to a Media Program to study Photography, Movie making and some Interactive Design.
        </p>
        <p>
          But my life changed a lot and many years later i was about to become a nurse for the elderly and that was when my hips gave up, only 27 years old. So i had to quit my studies and my job and rethink my life once again. And thank god that it happened, because without that i would of not have found CSS-Tricks, and through there Teamtreehouse.
        </p>
        <p>So since April '13 i have been a Treehouse student, and i am currently enrolled in a Swedish Vocational University to become a Front-End JavaScript Developer, and now enrolled in Treehouse's brand new Tech degree as a beta tester.</p>
        <p>My goal is to fill this page with work and experience, but first comes studies!</p>
        <p>Much Love and thanks to the whole world for givind me and my mom a new chance.</p>
